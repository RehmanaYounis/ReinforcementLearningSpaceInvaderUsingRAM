# ReinforcementLearningSpaceInvaderUsingRAM

In this project, I implement a deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using reinforcement learning. We chose to work with RAM Monitor. In this case, environmental monitoring is provided by the state of the RAM, that is, a set of 128 values. Each value is a byte (an integer from 0 to 255). RAM is a compact representation of state compared to algorithms that display the image as a state. In this environment, the player can perform 6 actions: NOOP, RIGHT, LEFT, FIRE, RIGHTFIRE and LEFTFIRE. The reward in the Space Invaders gym environment is the result in the given time step. We notice that different invaders (aliens) have different ranks.

Motivation 
Quote - Gaming is an Intelligent Art. PERIOD.
As kids we always were intrigued with gaming and computers. One specific part of gaming is 
Arcade games which involves custom built machines which has its own ways of playing each 
game. One such popular game is Space Invaders. As humans we are always looking for some 
extra-terrestrial existence and our race might be invaded some day from the outlanders. This 
game simulates the very scenario in a beautiful and intuitive way. As kids we always loved 
playing and trying to save the planet from this invasion.
Now the A.I field has become so advanced that we can write an effective algorithm, use neural 
network to process the information at hand, learn over practice just like any human does and 
with some tinkering can also outplay many gifted gamers in the world.
We wanted to learn and implement these techniques and train an agent to play just like a human 
being. This agent will use only the present state of the environment and make decisions by 
learning over the time. The very thought is straight from sci-fi but in this generation, it is 
possible for an agent to play with high performance and sometimes better than us.
