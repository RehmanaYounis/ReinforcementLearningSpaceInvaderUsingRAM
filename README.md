# ReinforcementLearningSpaceInvaderUsingRAM

In this project, I implement a deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using reinforcement learning. We chose to work with RAM Monitor. In this case, environmental monitoring is provided by the state of the RAM, that is, a set of 128 values. Each value is a byte (an integer from 0 to 255). RAM is a compact representation of state compared to algorithms that display the image as a state. In this environment, the player can perform 6 actions: NOOP, RIGHT, LEFT, FIRE, RIGHTFIRE and LEFTFIRE. The reward in the Space Invaders gym environment is the result in the given time step. We notice that different invaders (aliens) have different ranks.
